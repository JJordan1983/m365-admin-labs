## üõ°Ô∏è GCC / Licensing Notes

This portfolio was built in a **Microsoft 365 E3 (no Teams)** tenant with **Purview Discovery** enabled.  

- **Teams labs** are demonstrated with scripts + documentation. Live execution is limited due to licensing.  
- **Dynamics 365 labs** use a trial instance where available.  
- **Purview labs** are fully implemented: sensitivity labels, retention policies, and eDiscovery cases.  

This shows awareness of real-world licensing and GCC tenant constraints.
